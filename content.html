        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="content">
          Hey, I'm Gautam! Currently, I'm in my 4th semester at NIT Silchar,
          pursuing B.Tech. But beyond academics, fitness is my true passion.
          I've experienced firsthand how the right training and nutrition can
          completely transform not just your body, but also your confidence and
          mindset. Whether you're just starting or looking to level up, I'm here
          to guide and support you on this journey. Let's grow stronger
          together!
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            My fitness journey started when I joined my B.Tech program at NIT Silchar. I began working out at my campus gym, but due to a hectic academic schedule (8 AM - 5 PM) and limited equipment availability, I had to adapt. Eventually, I transitioned to calisthenics, focusing on bodyweight training to stay fit.

During my winter vacation in December 2024, I got the opportunity to train with weights at my hometown gym. In just 4 weeks of consistent weight training, I gained 4 kg of pure muscle mass—proving to myself how effective structured training and proper nutrition can be. But as January arrived, I returned to campus and resumed calisthenics, which continues to be my primary training method.

Being a student living in a hostel, maintaining a healthy diet is another challenge. The mess food isn't always nutritious or hygienic, but I make conscious efforts to eat clean. I've completely quit fast foods like chips and cold drinks, and I strictly avoid alcohol and smoking—because fitness is a lifestyle, not just a phase.

From March 21, 2025, I have also started taking creatine as a supplement to enhance my performance and recovery. I'll be tracking my progress and will soon update with photos of my results.

My journey is far from over, but I'm here to keep learning, improving, and inspiring others to build discipline and achieve their fitness goals—no matter the obstacles
        </p>

        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p class="content">
          My mission is to help beginners, busy professionals, and students take
          control of their fitness journey. I focus on making fitness simple,
          effective, and sustainable through smart training and balanced
          nutrition. No shortcuts, no crash diets—just real progress that fits
          into your lifestyle. Fitness is more than just lifting weights or
          following a diet; it's about transforming your mindset and lifestyle.
          My vision is to empower people to become the best version of
          themselves while building a supportive community where we grow
          stronger together. I'm passionate about guiding you through this
          journey, helping you build strength, confidence, and discipline every
          step of the way!
        </p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p class="content"> <h3> Train Smart, Not Just Hard</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> I focus on a mix of calisthenics and strength training for a well-rounded fitness routine.</li>
                <li>Workouts are designed for progressive overload, endurance, and functional strength.</li>
                <li>Whether you're at home or in the gym, there's always a way to challenge yourself and improve.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Eat Better, Feel Better</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Nutrition is just as important as training—I focus on clean, balanced eating.
                </li>
                <li>I take creatine for strength, but real food remains my foundation for muscle growth.
                </li>
                <li>Even with hostel food challenges, I avoid junk, processed food, and sugary drinks.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Workout = Instant Mood Boost</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Exercise helps reduce stress, anxiety, and depression by balancing hormones like dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins.</li>
                <li>You don't need fake dopamine from social media—working out gives you the real happiness boost</li>
                <li>A strong body leads to a strong mind, improving focus, confidence, and mental well-being.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Simple & Sustainable for Any Lifestyle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether you're a busy student, a working professional, or just getting started, fitness should fit into your life.</li>
                <li> I believe in realistic, easy-to-follow routines that don't overwhelm you.</li>
                <li>Small, consistent efforts lead to big transformations over time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Discipline Over Motivation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Motivation fades, but discipline keeps you going every single day.</li>
                <li> Discipline is the purest form of self-love—taking care of your body means valuing yourself.</li>
                <li>Progress happens when you show up even when you don't feel like it.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Let's Grow Stronger Together!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>No matter where you are in your fitness journey, I'm here to help you build strength and confidence.</li>
                <li>My goal is to create a supportive community where we push each other forward.</li>
                <li>Let's get stronger, both physically and mentally, together!</li>
